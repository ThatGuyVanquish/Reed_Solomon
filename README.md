# Reed Solomon Implementation of the Unique Decoder in Java
### This is my initial attempt to code the unique decoder (Berlekamp-Welch) and the list decoder (Sudan) algorithms in Java from scratch, I.E. building most of the functions myself, for a university project in the class of Topics in Error Correction Codes.

### After successfully implementing the unique decoder I've realized I will be missing some very important methods for bivariate factorization that I could not implement within the allocated time period for submission, therefore I decided to switch to using Sage with python, as can be seen in my repository [ReedSolomon_Sage](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/ReedSolomon_Sage).

### This repository includes the code I've written for the Unique Decoder implementation and tests written for JUnit, alongside my [attempt at the list decoder](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/Reed_Solomon/tree/list_decoding), which has my implementation of a bivariate polynomial class and changes to interpolation of bivariate polynomials and tests for said class and the list decoder.
